## Lab 05, Part 1 (10 pts)

Write a simple shell script to move (rename) all `*.PDF` files under the current directory (if any) to `*.pdf` and report each action, otherwise just report there are no `*.PDF` files.

### Example

* move `test.PDF` to `test.pdf`
* move `hello.PDF.PDF` to `hello.PDF.pdf`
* move `.hello.PDF.PDF` to `.hello.PDF.pdf`
